title: Sensitive information
---

Here's what you need to know about sensitive information at 18F.

## What is considered sensitive

To learn more about what information is considered sensitive, see [our Open Source Policy practices guide](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/practice.md#protecting-sensitive-information).

## Tools

There are several options for sharing sensitive information at 18F. As you'll remember from your Security Awareness and Privacy training in [GSA Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov), please make sure to share sensitive information with only the people that absolutely need it, and who are authorized to see it.

### Fugacious

[Fugacious](https://fugacious.18f.gov/) is a tool for short-term secure messaging. Fugacious is most useful for sending small bits of text once, such as passwords or API keys. We recommend setting the lowest acceptable "self-destruct" settings that you can. Fugacious links can be shared over Slack, but please don't put sensitive information in Slack directly.

### Google Drive

[Google Drive](../google-drive/) can be used for sharing sensitive files, spreadsheets, and documents.

### OMB MAX

[OMB MAX](https://max.omb.gov/) is a tool that's provided by/for the federal government, which can be used for sharing files. MAX is most likely to be used with partners who don't have access to (or who don't feel comfortable putting the information in) Google Drive.
