# Responsible Disclosure Policy

We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the security community. The responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.

## Guidelines

We require that all researchers:
* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing;
* Perform research only within the scope set out below; 
* Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us; and
* Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and the United States government until we’ve had 90 days to resolve the issue.

## Scope 
* [insert endpoints / systems here]

## Out of scope

Any services not listed under `Scope` above are excluded from scope. These services include but may not be limited to:

* External APIs called by the applications of the TTS 
* AWS instances of TTS systems not listed in the ‘Scope’ section

In the interest of the safety of our users, staff, the internet at large and you as a security researcher, the following test types are excluded from scope: 
* Findings from physical testing such as office access (e.g. open doors, tailgating)
* Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing)
* Findings from applications or systems not listed in the ‘Scope’ section
* UI and UX bugs and spelling mistakes
* Network level Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) vulnerabilities

Things we do not want to receive: 
* Personally identifiable information (PII) 
* Credit card holder data 

## Authorization
If you follow the _entirety_ of this disclosure when reporting an issue to us, we will consider your security research to be authorized, and in addition, we will:
* Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours of submission); 
* Recognize your contribution on [TBD]

## How to report a security vulnerability?
If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in one of our products or platforms please send it to us by emailing [TBD]. Please include the following details with your report:

* Description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability;
* A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts, screenshots, and compressed screen captures are all helpful to us); and
* Your name/handle and a link for recognition in our Hall of Fame.

If you’d like to encrypt the information, please use our [PGP key].
