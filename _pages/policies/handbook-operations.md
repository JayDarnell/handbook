# Handbook operations

In order to keep all of 18F up-to-date on the latest policies and procedures, it is the responsibility of each leader within 18F to keep their documentation up to date.

Each page in the Handbook has an owner. This person should also be functionally the owner of that policy, procedure, or data. While they do not have to personally keep the Handbook current, they are personally accountable for whatever process does ensure the information on their pages stays fresh. 

[tbd - insert new Handbook page metadata so each page actually has an owner]

Current owners include, but are not limited to:

* Operations 
    * [examples]
* Infrastructure 
    * [examples]
* Design 
    * [examples]
* Engineering
	* [examples]
* On-boarding Working Group
	* [examples]

[tbd - if people are good with this, we would also modify the intro to the `README and Handbook landing page to make this clear]

Nothing in this policy should be construed as discouraging anyone in the organization from suggesting updates or improvements to the Handbook's content. Such improvements are strongly *encouraged*. In keeping with good pull request culture, always ensure the relevant content owner is assigned to the pull request, so they can get a notification about your purposed change.
