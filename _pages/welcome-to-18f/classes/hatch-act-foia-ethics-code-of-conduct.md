**Check with your director to see if you're required to fill out this form:**

- [Confidential Financial Disclosure Report (OGE 450)](https://www2.oge.gov/Web/oge.nsf/Resources/OGE+Form+450:+Confidential+Financial+Disclosure+Report). 
 
You have 30 days from the date you came onboard 18F to get this completed and back. You must sign it with a pen. (We don't have access to the PIV card reader that allows you to sign this digitally.)

If you are in DC, you can bring it to room 2005.
If you are in SF, you can bring it to the Regional Counsel in room 4130. They will mail it to the General Counsel in DC.

If you’re not in DC or SF, please mail the signed original the form to:

Office of the General Counsel
ATTN: Jacqueline Henry / OGE-450
General Services Administration
1800 F Street NW
Washington, DC 20405

Note that the office does not accept physically signed, scanned copies so you must send the original.

**Everyone at 18F has to fill out the following form:**

- [Acknowledgment of Receipt of Standards of Conduct (GSA-2160)](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/114346). You likely filled this out at your Ethics training during GSA orientation. If you haven&rsquo;t completed it, please send it to your GSA rep from your orientation as soon as you can.

Please note that GSA&rsquo;s Office of General Counsel is your legal resource as a GSA employee. _Nothing in this document should be considered legal advice._ If you have questions, please reach out to the 18F-OGC point of contact, [John Peters](mailto:john.h.peters@gsa.gov); he can provide you with the answers you need.

## <a id="foia">FOIA</a>

FOIA is short for the Freedom of Information Act. In sum, any citizen can request information from the U.S. Government and get it, with some exceptions. As a consequence **federal employees shouldn&rsquo;t have an expectation of privacy when using government property or technology.**

With regard to your work at 18F, this means a few things:

- **Your workplace conversations are most likely subject to FOIA.** Any Slack conversation, for example, whether &ldquo;public&rdquo; or &ldquo;private,&rdquo; and any email is subject to compliance exports and potentially part of the public record. Basically anything we say and do on government laptops and phones, in government buildings, or on government time is subject to FOIA.

- **Using your personal devices to do government work doesn&rsquo;t inherently subject you to FOIA.** This ultimately boils down to the government&rsquo;s data and where it lives: So long as the data you&rsquo;re accessing isn&rsquo;t solely stored on your device, you&rsquo;re in the clear. So, say you access your government Gmail from your home computer. Because your email is stored on Google&rsquo;s servers &mdash; it isn&rsquo;t the only copy of that email &mdash; accessing your government email doesn&rsquo;t inherently open you up to FOIA. GSA IT still has the ability terminate that access (between 18F&rsquo;s &ldquo;Google Apps for Government&rdquo; service and your personal device), of course.

- **You should still be careful about doing government work on your personal device,** though, because if the work that you&rsquo;re doing is &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; &mdash; if it&rsquo;s the only source of that information &mdash; your personal device can be subject to FOIA. If it is being mirrored to a federal run git server, GitHub, or any other service (like a server in AWS), you&rsquo;re in the clear. This also applies to non-code assets.

- **Personal data sent over federal networks (including hotspots) is potentially subject to FOIA.** Members of the public _could_ file a FOIA request for this information. Since the government tracks and stores all data going in and out of federal networks, this &ldquo;record&rdquo; is within the scope of FOIA. There are [FOIA exemptions](http://www.foia.gov/faq.html#exemptions) that may apply to situations like these.


## <a id="ethics">Ethics</a>

As a government employee, it&rsquo;s incumbent upon you to think through the ethical implications of your work and the activities in which you&rsquo;re involved. Our core ethical requirements are described in the [Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch](https://www.oge.gov/Web/oge.nsf/Resources/Standards+of+Ethical+Conduct+for+Employees+of+the+Executive+Branch), published by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics ([summary](https://www.oge.gov/Web/oge.nsf/Employee%20Standards%20of%20Conduct)).

Below are resources 18F employees often ask about:

- **Gifts for government employees.** The U.S. Office of Government Ethics has [a detailed guide](https://www.oge.gov/Web/OGE.nsf/Gifts%20and%20Payments) on what types of gifts and payment you can receive as a government employee. When in doubt, ask on Slack or check with your supervisor.

- **Ask before you act.** Once again, 18F&rsquo;s point of contact at the GSA&rsquo;s Office of General Counsel (often called OGC) is [John Peters](mailto:john.h.peters@gsa.gov). Feel free to contact John directly with any ethics-related questions. And if you get guidance that you think other 18F team members may benefit from, **please share it!** If John Peters is out of the office for any reason and you need an immediate answer to an ethics-related question, you can contact [Ken Sharrett](mailto:kenneth.sharrett@gsa.gov). For event- and speaking-related legal and ethics questions, contact [Pia Scott](mailto:pia.scott@gsa.gov).

 - As further encouragement to ask, check out [page 7 of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch](https://www.oge.gov/Web/oge.nsf/0/076ABBBFC3B026A785257F14006929A2/$FILE/SOC%20as%20of%2076%20FR%2038547.pdf), which includes: *"Employees who have questions about the application of this part or any supplemental agency regulations to particular situations should seek advice from an agency ethics official. Disciplinary action for violating this part or any supplemental agency regulations will not be taken against an employee who has engaged in conduct in good faith reliance upon the advice of an agency ethics official, provided that the employee, in seeking such advice, has made full disclosure of all relevant circumstances."*


## <a id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>

One of 18F&rsquo;s core values is working in the public: interfacing with other agencies and even regular ol&rsquo; citizens as part of our work. Your conduct is a reflection of 18F.

[18F has instituted a Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct) that applies to all mediums: in-person, digital, everything! We expect you to adhere to the Code at all times. Adhering to the Code is as important as your work performance as it directly impacts everyone else&rsquo;s ability to feel welcome and respected for who they are.
